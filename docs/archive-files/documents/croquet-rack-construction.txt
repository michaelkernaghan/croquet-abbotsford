I'm Kevin Briton today's lesson on croquet tactics is about the skill of scoring a hoop for a ball other than the
Striker's ball this is called peeling let's watch my assistant Fred as
he shows us a typical peel and we learn some of the special terms that we will
use we'll go down to the third hoop which of course is also hoop four back
in the opposite direction Fred's Striker ball is black and it is about to score
hoop three as Fred's partner ball blue is already for hoop four back will'll
place his blue clip on the side of the hoop Fred rushes blue as a pilot near
the hoop and makes hoop three for
black in his next cro stroke he peels blue through the hoop to score four back
for blue we'll be looking at this four back peel in Greater detail later on but for
now let's just remove Blue's clip as it's already made its hoop the ball that is peeled is called a
PE e normally we need another ball close by so that we could escape from the situation it is called an escape
ball it's very important that the Escape ball yellow in this case should be
placed to allow the break to continue without difficulty so Fred players South
in the direction of Black's break now sometimes a PE will fail to clear the hoop and remain in the Jaws it
is said to be a jawed peel in such cases black will have
another opportunity later on to return to the hoop and complete the peel with a
ret here it is jawed and now let's have a look at what is called a rush peel
black will complete the peel by rushing black onto blue and scoring the hoop for
blue in the next example both balls are for the same
hoop both for four back Fred will now play what is called a
straight peel sending blue through forb back and
following by making the same hoop with black note that if black remains too
close to the hoop in the next stroke it will be hampered because the hoop will interfere with Fred's back
swing again an escape ball can be placed to allow clean swing for The Brak to
continue let's summarize these basic
skills first of all as we've seen you must plan ahead to have a PE and an escape ball near your target hoop
secondly you must take care that the Escape ball is placed correctly this not only avoids hampered shots as we have
seen but it may also be essential to provide a pilot at the next hoop in this
case we call the Escape ball an escape pilot for example here Fred has been
unable to peel blue through forb back until after his fifth hoop as there was
no Pioneer at hoop six Fred uses the Escape ball as an escape pilot and
rushes it into position at hoop six lastly you may have to allow for the
fact that a PE will not necessarily travel along the line of centers this
Divergence is called pull if we strike on the line of centers
Pull
with our Mallet it will Propel the front ball in a direct line however if we strike at an angle
the front ball will diverge towards the angle at which we strike the ball this
is known as pull so either line up straight and play
a straight stop shot or line up the centers to allow for this
pull let's watch Robert fford a three times world champion demonstrate this
interesting point it's worth noting that Robert completed his first triple peel
after only playing cro for 5 months since then he has done nearly 500
triples in tournament play including a break of 19 triples in consecutive games
in
1992 well I think that's lined up I'm just going to play this just
straight at the
hoop okay there's an example of a nice straight
peel okay again this example I'm going to line up the balls so the centers of
black and blue make a line pointing straight at the middle of the hoop this time I'm not going to play
directly towards the
hoop okay this example I'm not going to play the shot straight I'm going to play the
shot at an angle hitting black off towards the left we're going to see what happens to the blue
ball okay now this time I'm going to play the peel with a bit of split
as you can see it's missed what did I do
wrong this last example this time I'm not going to
aim the line through the cent of black and blue at the middle of the hoop I'm actually going to allow for the
pull so that when I play a shot sending black to the left Blue's
going to be drawn to the left and hopefully go through the
hoop this time having allowed for the effect of the pull blue
should go nicely through one of the most effective uses
of peeling is to be seen in the triple peel written down as TP let's see why this tactic has come to dominate
skillful play in games played under the rules of advanced play some important concern sessions are made in favor of
Intro to Triple Peel
the out player the oppon when your opponent makes one
back you can start your turn by lifting a ball and playing from a
bork this is called a lift and it also applies when hoop four back is
scored however if your opponent makes one back and four back in the same
turn as here you might take cro from any ball this is called
Contact to avoid this brakes normally stop at three back which leaves three
Hoops to be completed if a player scores these last three Hoops for an opponent
by triple peeling it is called a TP normally these last three Hoops are
Standard Triple Peel (part 1)
made for your partner ball while the backward ball makes a full break let's
watch Robert do a stand triple
peel okay well first thing I've got to do is get the brake under
control so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to hit the
red bring it out into court and
then after I finish being attacked by leaves try and get a rush on Blue across
the the yellow
ball so Red's nicely out in his court I'm going to try and Rush this somewhere
I can play a little shot sending blue to two getting a rushi on yellow to
I would like to have rushed that a little bit closer to Yellow but I should certainly be able to
get blue hoop
too not feeling thinking about peeling too much at the minute but it is going to help if I make ho two
with a great deal of control then I can Rush blur across the hoop three and peel out but at the
minute I'm really just concentrating on getting that rush to First
hoop that looks all
right just got to take a little bit of care here just got a about an 18in dead
straight Rush and that's a little bit
soft always prefer to be in front of the
hoop but I'm close enough I shouldn't really have too much trouble I'm going to try and get a rush across the red
just organize the balls a little bit
better so it's a little bit hard
[Music]
and I'm free first tube that's probably the hardest bit of the triple peel for
me Ain getting through the first hoop I'm just going to try and get a
nice rush to Red just organize the balls a bit better
I just meant to cut that a little bit more this again just had a slightly
shorter shot getting behind the
red going to transcend yellow a hoop
4 there's a good Pine here I won't come back to that again until I've actually
come to making hoop 4 I'm going to concent a Russian red over towards the
blue
ball that's okay now I'm going to rush the red somewhere where I've got enough
space to get red all the way to hoop free going to the blue
ball and I didn't quite mean to have that much
space but
again not a particularly difficult Croy strike at least but going to be going up the line towards
blue I've un fortunately
left left ho six in the way I'm going to have to aim for red to finish probably a
little further south of hoop three than I'd like just to make sure I miss that hoop I
concentrate getting a nice Rush on the
blue and I've just played a bit too much of a stop
shot like to be a little bit closer to Blue just want to hit this Le blue
nicely in front of the hoop oh dear
well I very much need a rush across to hoop two to hoop three
sorry so got to play quite a good shot here getting black accurately in front
and leaving blue somewhere where it's just going to be right for running the hoop
too that's a pretty good shot just need to run the hoop by about 2
feet just run a little bit too far but it's quite a good rush I'm going to try and Rush this slightly to the far side
of the hoop because that's going to make it easier to get behind
Red I've left it a little bit short but it's not a bad
spot I'm going to try and put blue pretty accurately in
front and get some kind of Rush on red to to in front of hoop
three so Blue's about a yard away from the hoop
this isn't going to be particularly accurate peel for me I like to be play on my peels from about 6 in if I
can but going to put blue going to put red quite a long way
up so that I'm going to be able to pay this peel with a straight stop shot and
get some kind of Rush on the red
just working at exactly where I want
[Music]
it and I'm going to try and run this hoop hope to just miss blue and actually
get a rush on Blue back to in front of the hoop but I might hit blue
well haven't run the hoop cleanly enough so I'm just going to cut blue to
a bit straighter and this is a typical sort of
position you haven't got that much control you're going for the probably
the best way to go for the peel is with a nice straight stop shot and I tend to play the is hard
enough so basically blue goes through without touching the wire it'll stay
probably a couple of yards on the on the court so quite quite
hard just take a bit of care over lining it
up that's gone through nicely all right so just took a little
bit of care to make make sure blue went the the black ball went slightly to the right there just to make sure I wasn't
hampered by the hoop and I've got not a great rush but
some kind of Rush and I was able to play the peel in a way which was pretty likely to
succeed I was trying to cut that a little bit more
now there's nothing wrong with past rolling the red to five here if you've
got that shot but I don't really possess that shot so I'm just going to take off and move red a little bit closer to
five it's not a bad Pioneer there just going to try and knock the
yellow right in front of the hoop [Music]
okay now the way I like to go about trying to organize the balls for the pan
out peel as I always try and get a rush back on yellow back behind
blue so just going to try and run this hoop and get a rush
nicely back to Behind
Blue that's pretty good that's pretty possibly a little bit too close to
Blue we'll see when I get there I was trying to rush it just a a bit further to my
right I probably don't quite have enough room to get yellow all the way to hoop 6 I
get it pretty close I'm trying to organize both blue and yellow at hoop 6 for the penal
[Music]
peel well I could have hit that a bit harder and probably got yellow all the way
there now I've got to make a decision here I can I Rush blue all the way down
the court and cro it back to hoop six or I can just hit it straight to hoop six
um I think I'm just going to hit it straight to hoop six now one thing I've got to do here is try and make sure I
don't leave hoop six or the peg in the way my takeoff to Red so just trying to
rush it well I tried to rush it couple of yards further than that I've been very
lucky it's just really trying to rush it to a point up here should have
been out of danger but nearly finished with
blue and what would have been about 6 in peeling position but would have been about the worst spot you could you could
hope for so lucky not to have any furniture in the way
I'm just concentrating on getting a nice Russian
red and that's pretty good I want to get a forward rush out of hoop five so I'm
going to rush this to probably at least a yard in front that's pretty
nice and I want to get a a rush back up behind
[Music] yellow
so got nice control here all the balls are pretty close to where I want
them going to send red over as a one back Pioneer and
bring the yellow over to hoop six as my skate
ball now this peel I'm going to be able to do with much more control than the forbat
peel cuz just a little bit more
organized so that's a not a very good
shot now got myself in a bit of a mess here
I've put yellow a little bit too straight wanted yellow slightly wider I really
want to be able to rush blue to a slightly better place than this this is not too much of a
problem so I'm going to run the hoop and hit blue and I've actually deliberately left
blue so hopefully it's going to go slightly to my
left I wanted yellow to go slight to the left cuz if it hadn't the hoop would have
been in the way of getting to a yellow so if I haven't got a straight peel out given I didn't put yellow in quite
the right place really wanted yellow more over
here it's uh it's probably pretty useful but I'm
here I like to play this peel nice and nice and hard
it's slightly awkward if the peel only goes through by an inch or two I like to peel it hard enough so maybe it'll even
go down to Rover I'm conc getting behind yellow with a
black so I'm going to rush yellow back so I can send it all all the way up to
two back going to the
red and things are going pretty well now I've been a bit careless there Red's
Plumbing the way I'm going to have to put yellow a little bit more to a left of
two back than I would normally lie
and it curled a bit to the right anyway it's
um just going to concentrate and getting a nice rush over to behind the
blueit that a little bit
sensitively oh I've just got a try and make sure this time I don't put any furniture in the
[Music] way so I'm going to put red down to
freeb back now the next peel I'm hoping to do is to peel Rover going to this
freeb P here there are a number of opportunities to do the Rover peel but
Standard Triple Peel (part 2)
in this case as we'll see Robert is making it going to three
back now this position of this Ball's quite important because they're going to have
to peel Rover going to this going to this ball so wants to be on Rover's side
of freeb I'm going to try and get a nice Rush on Blue up the
court and prefer it slightly nearer to free than that but it's it's quite an
easy place to get to from Rover now I could try and Rush blue pretty
near to Rover straight away but the Peg's in the way so I'm going to rush blue near to Yellow concentrate getting
a good Rush on yellow to two back and I should be able to in the same
shop put blue pretty squarely in front of Rover
well a bit too close to Yellow I just wanted blue to go another
yard in that last shot and I might have to take a slight
Liberty with a quality of my Rush on the yellow just to get blue all the way to in front of the hoop
[Music]
and that's quite a big Liberty really but let's see what I can do with this
cut uh it's pretty good
it's so I'm going to make this hoop and then send the yellow to fullback try
again a rush on Blue right to in front of Rover
so I just want to hit yellow to somewhere where I've got a nice stop shot I can really try and get
black right on the spot a perfect Rush on
Blue I think that's just right yellow could have gone on have a yard
but it looks pretty good so just got to concentrate leaving
blue right in front and that's pretty
good now I'm just going to play this peel now
there's a fair amount of split on this peel which means got to allow something
for pull which means I'm going to aim blue slightly at the right hand wire but
only slightly I've got I'm only about a foot away from the hoop and I'm going to trust that blue is
going to do the right thing and concentrate on the black getting a nice Rush on the
red Blue's only just gone through but it's through I've got a nice
Russian red
and I could have hit that a little bit harder to finish straight in front of the hoop anyway done all the peels now I've
just got to finish the brake would have been nice of blue gone a little bit further through and then I
could have rushed blue up to CT to yellow and it would have been very
useful but it's it's it's useless where it is I can't rush it up the court at all so I'm going to try and get to rush
up the court on red
and I've hit that that a bit too hard I was very lucky there as it is I've got
about a 4in perfect
rush I'm just concentrating on making these hoops under
control I've managed to get yellow PL in the way I think so I'm going to have to put
Blue uh red sorry put red going to put red about 5T in front
of panel it's curled around a bit actually
so it's finished pretty well placed
[Music] I don't think I'm going to worry about
blue at all at the minute just going to play a freeall
break for FR panol but I don't want to make Rover off
blue I'm blue nice near the peg before I make
Rover so yellow's going to be my Rover pioneer
and I really want to forward rush out of penultimate to make it easy to get to [Music]
Blue and now now it's really all over whoops luckily that's not a fault in cro
because I do that every now and
then really I've got more balls when I know what to do with now I'm going to leave red behind
overover just in case of some pooling shut it R
it EXC me H now I
can stop shot red sorry stop shot the blue right on top of the
peg so I'm not going to have any trouble picking it out at all and that's probably a little bit too
close to the peg well it's really not a problem at
all even though if I Ro it into the
peg I won't be able to take Cy off it really shouldn't be any trouble to
get a rushing away from the peg
you would have rushed yellow the other side of the peg I could even have Cannon blue onto the peg with the yellow and
then pegged the black out and they I just not blow away from
the
peg there you go triple
Intro to Delayed Triple Peel
peel the standard trip requires you to have command of all the balls as you approach hoop three if this is not
possible we call it a delayed triple peel how we describe the solutions to solving this problem depends very much
on which Strokes are used to do the peel for instance peeling after hoop six
is not necessarily the same as peeling before hoop one back remember we have
six Strokes between each hoop and how we describe the solution will depend depend
on which of these Strokes are used to make the peel here after black has made hoop six
if he uses the first or second Strokes available to him to make the peel at four back we would describe the peel as
being made after hoop six but if he uses the third or fourth Strokes to make the peel we would talk
about it as a peel before one back his fifth and sixth Strokes of course will
be used to clear Black's next hoop in this case
Jawsed 4-back Peel after H3
a common problem is for the peel at forb back to remain in the Jaws let's see how Robert solves this
problem okay blue is in my jaws and fullback so want to go and move it out
so but it's just in the middle of the court it's not a
problem I want to rush yellow to somewhere where it's going to be easy to send yellow over to
hoop six and Rush the blue through
fullback that's not a bad spot for the yellow so
make sure I've got a good shot of the blue
[Music]
here free blue
goes I'm just going to take off the
red there wouldn't be anything wrong with playing a playing a role here trying to
put blue towards hoop six or the middle of the Court
um but really I prefer just to take off and try and get a rush back towards
third
corner and I've gone into red
been to approach in a slightly better spot but this is okay to try and get a rush back roughly towards third corner
so I can send blue send red to one back and get a rush on Blue towards penel
[Music]
and I hope that's going to miss the well it's allowed to hit that
much and now I've got a nice easy spot to send red to one back and Rush
blue towards a spot in front of Penal
notice that this puts the balls in position for Robert to continue with a standard
Jawsed 4-back Peel after H4
triple sometimes however the peel at four back will still be jawed after hoop
four let's have a look at the solution to this problem
okay in this case we've had to leave going to Blue just a little bit later typically this
would have been a result of not getting any kind of rush out of 4 so you have decided not to
go and touch the blue so I'm going to try and get a rush
somewhere where I can put red over to one back going to the
blue that wasn't a very good hoop approach should be all
right just about all right I'm just going to rush the red
down Beyond
blue well I really wanted to be at a spot maybe five yards to the right
of blue but this spot
is okay I can still cro red where I want to and get a hit on blue
you can see I'm quite a long way away from Blue definitely be getting the Umpire
out for this in a real
game now if you notice where the red is it's
not particularly accurate one bik bar here but it's there for a purpose and that's
what if I don't roll blue right in front here going to be able to peel penultimate
going to the red so I'm going to try and put Blue in front butly at this range
the odds aren't all that
high and I've not played a particularly good shot
there s blue a long way too far but still
[Music]
okay so I'm going to send yellow to tuac and try get a rush on Blue into
peeling position I mean normally I would expect with a role I played across
from fullback at least I blew a bit close to pen from this
but we'll have to see what we can
[Music]
do just going to try and Rush blue in front of pel
[Music]
this is quite a wide angle peel so I'm going to have to allow a lot of pull I'm
going to concentrate on getting a rush on the red ball see what I can do with the
blue and that's probably not bad if the balls have not been rounded
4-back Peel before H6
up early enough or the fullback peel has simp failed there is another opportunity
to make the fullback peel before hoop six this also demonstrates getting a
rush on the Escape ball to the next
hoop okay got here an example of we haven't been able to get all four
balls at the start of the break
[Music] what I'm going to do is demonstrate how
to get organized for try and peel Flor back getting a rush across the hoop
six the first thing we got to do is get the yellow now some people would like to just hit
this ball leave it here somewhere useful and take off to the I'm trying to avoid
having to take off all the way to the yoa can i'
rather come over here and play a split chop going to Yellow from
halfway now it's just a matter of taste really if you're relatively good at takeoffs and
not split shots you may prefer just to try and leave that Red there and you can leave it
very nicely placed so it's already uh in a way placed as the Escape ball for that
peel peeling fullback gain to hoop six but this is just a more accurate way for me of getting to the yellow
[Music]
ball not placed red very well
there at least only three yards away from yellow very easy
to take off from Full back and finish five yards
away now I'm going to put yellow right back to fullback
and just go to Blue actually interested in having a go at Rushing blue up to
fullback after making hoop 4 and actually peeling it but basically I'm just thinking about
being organized for that peel going to hoop six
go yellow you touch too far but it's a good place already
for peeling the blue going to it I'm just trying to get a rush straight back
up the court
here this C blue a little bit too far
um a little bit worried about rushing the blue back into Bo for so not really going to
try and Rush this into peing position I'm just going to try and rush it near to yellow and I've hit
it pretty straight I've just hit a bit too gently you could see if I'd have rushed
it another five yards i' have possibly being able to have a get
peeling it straight away um I mean obviously I could peel it from here but I'd rather just make sure
I leave it in front if I go for the peel I probably
miss and leave Blue down on the the boundary which would't be much use at
all I'm just going to roll blue close to peeling
position and go to the
yellow I want to leave yellow somewhere I'm going to be able to peel the blue and get a a rush over to hoop six it's a
pretty good spot right now or I could try and leave it in a spot where I just
play a little straight stop shot and I'll get a straight Rush on
yellow I'm just going to hit yellow very gently I'm going to take off to that
red this is a bit risky because Red's quite a long way away from ho five
if I rushed yellow all the way down to the boundary the odds are actually putting yellow in a good place from on
the south bounda pretty low so I'd rather go for this slightly
more positive
approach hit that a bit too far
I made it all look rather
hairy this Stu played a good approach so I'm looking for a rush on the red so I
can send red to one back and go of the blue and then been a bit unlucky there
the angle blacks come through the hoop have to quite quite a quite a big
cut and cut it as much as I want to and I was lucky not to hit red into either the
yellow or the blue which could have been quite awkward I'm nothing too bad of
spart just going to try and send red over to one
back and just missed the blue with this Cy
stroke I'm going to actually try and leave red in front of one back so that
possibly I'd be in position to peel blue down to one back if I had to
if I excuse me if I had
to uh manag to mess this [Music]
up it's not quite where I wanted a bit I've a nice Russ on Blue want to hit it
very gently
[Music] I should be able to peel this through and
get a rush on yellow right in front of hoop
six play this fairly firmly I want it to go
[Music]
through make sure the Hoops not hampering me on my Shir on
yellow now I've just got a try and Rush yellow to in front of hoop six and make
hoop [Music]
six that's terrible but I should at least still
make the hoop it's got to do one good takeoff
[Music]
oh one good hoop
[Music]
shop and now I've got peel down and I've got all four RS into my brake and
hopefully I can finish off with a nice delay double which I'll
demonstrate in a minute before looking at these later peels let's look at the four back peel
4-back Peel before 1-back
made before one back
[Music] well I'm not going to
demonstrate peeling one back peeling four back going to one
back this is probably the last relatively
safe time to peel [Music] fallback before actually peeling it
straight
and I've got red pretty well ideally
placed get yellow all the way up to two [Music]
back now I just want to put blue straight in front of the hoop
it's quite important what angle this peels done from cuz it affects very much
where black wants to go you're basically playing it with a takeoff type shot it's very hard to get black to go down a line
which isn't the natural takeoff line if you are this close to the hoop
you can actually don't have to aim blue quite at the center of the hoop
and again I just want to hit blue hard enough so it's definitely going to go through and it's definitely not going to
go [Music]
k Delayed Double Peel
off let's turn our attention now to peeling penultimate and Rover our first
example is known as a delayed double peel
right where I've now got the position set up for trying to do a delayed double
peel the first thing I want is actually want to forward rush out a freeb back wasn't going to have to play a very
long role so just going to concentrate on that
now I've got the bull set up very much like I had the ball set up for
peeling Hoops fullback trying to get a rush to
six that's not a very good Rush was trying to cut that over to
penate but I should be able to play a role from
here I'm trying to get a rush on the blue inter peeling position
in front of penel I'm also going to deliberately put yellow a little way behind penel even
though it's actually going to probably be my penel
[Music] Pioneer I was just particularly making
sure the yellow but it first of it didn't finish right behind the hoop so
in the end it might get tangled up with blue and most importantly to make sure it didn't finish in the way of getting
black behind the [Music] red so I'm going to try and peel the
blue and get a nice Rush on red over to
fullback I'm going to plug this pretty straight just enough so Black's going to miss the hoop
bl's gone quite a long way through I don't really mind exactly where it went through
too and could have play that Rush a little bit better I just be a little bit closer to
the hoop but this is nice and straight in front a little farther away
not a particularly good approach but should be fairly easy
hoop so now I want to concentrate on getting blue down
to very good position in front of
Rover so got a couple of choices I can try and Rush blue straight down there I can try and
rush it back behind yellow and croaky it up to over from
there I think I'm going to go for the cro stroke I think that's going to be the most accurate way for me
to play that putting red slightly to one side
there I don't want red right in front because that'll get in the way
so I've got to rush this behind the
yellow this is why yellows on this side of
penultimate yell was a yard in front of pen i' have to be another good another
five yards further away for Rover that just makes this shot that
much more inaccurate and this shot is really the critical shot if I can put this right in front
the rest of it turns
easy I think that's looking pretty good I could have got a better rush than
the LA but it's a little cut and so nicely
I've got a bit of room I want a forward
Straight Rover Peel
rash the delayed double peel also involves what is known as a straight
Rover peel now com up going to have to do what we
call the straight R peel that doesn't mean peeling from straight it means peeling as you're making the hoop
yourself and it's always best to try and organize the two other
balls so if you got one ball fairly close to the boundary
like to have it about three yards away from the bound of a can so
that I have to jump over anything it's in my way're that Ball's going to be down
there for me to hit I have a ball red in this gu so I just want to have a position so I make
the hoop gently Red's going to be right there for me to
hit and also it's going to be right there possibly the cannon the
blue um we'll talk about those possibilities
I'm
sure well I fell down a little bit of a hill there which means I haven't got a
rush so I'm going to have to play this peel from much f w than I intended to it's about a about a yard long whereas
it really should have been been able to get a nice rush and only be about a foot
away so I'm going to play this fairly gently try and leave
black about a foot short of the hoop
our best stop
shot okay now in an ideal situation blue would have gone about a couple of yards
through I'd have just been able to go through gently hit the red and take off
maybe take off behind the yellow first Get Behind Blue rush it to the peg now
unfortunately Blue's still very close to the hoop and I think it's going to be very unlikely that I'll be able to run
the hoop and finish short of blue um so I don't think it's worth the risk if I
play the shot that gently I'm quite likely to stick in the hoop so what I'm going to try and do is jump right over
the blue that's why yellow is where it
is that's a not that difficult a shot if
you could play a jump shot it's really not too difficult to do
that so thanks to having put the yellow nice and
deep I really want to be able to hit
this and having placed the red quite
accurately close in behind Rover what I'm going to be able to do
is Cannon the red Into the Blue now the reason I've got to do that so if you can
see Rover's right in the way of rushing blue to the peg
so just going to play a little Cannon you don't it's only in places where
Blue's really close to the hoop but you need to do this
but it's not that difficult a thing to do especially we can get really really
close should be able to play a very controlled shot you just got to don't
want to really got to worry about red getting in the way so you really want to
play try and make sure that Reds is probably
bouncing away from black rather than towards black and play for don't play for a six
inch Rush give yourself a little bit of room for
error now I've got a nice rush to the Peg and all I've got to worry about now is not actually rushing it into the peg
so just going to try and rush it a little bit wide and
short and this is easy enough to P out from here
[Music]
[Music] if the last two Hoops are even more
Straight Double Peel
delayed the game will have to be concluded with a straight double
[Music]
peel okay we got the balls laid out here blue Ste for penultimate what I'm
going to do is demonstrate how to go about trying to
feel finish with a straight double peel under control
as near as the thing gets to being under control now what I'm going to try and do is play an Irish peel through panel
that's a shot where both black and blue make panel in the same stroke and get blue right down to Rover
even if it doesn't go right down to Rover I'm still going to try and finish by rushing
it to in front of Rover and peeling it and making the so don't really need a ball or Rover
what I'd rather have is leaving
yellow really this this side of the peg of anything so the blue only goes through maybe as as far as the
peg you're going to be able to use yellow to get an accurate rushing it down to in front of
Rover now want to leave red just on the
non-playing side of penol level with a hoop so if I play my
rpel and bl goes through by an inch I'm going to be able to hit it
so very easy to get hampered so you can't hit anything so I just want to try and put
blue absolutely straight in front they say if you've got control then AR peel really isn't that
hard I tend to imagine just playing a regular cro stroke and Black's going to
go to a spot which is straight on a line through the hoop so rather than trying to force myself to swing the Mallet
perfectly straight just like to play a drive where I'm imagining black going to the spot
directly through the hoop I got to play it nice and hard
Blue's going to go straight down to Rover hopefully once in a while it hits the peg but if
it peel it cleanly it should go all the way there
[Music] over and that's pretty
good and now we're back very where earlier I've just got the straight R
peel to do I'm going to put blue going to put red deep behind Rover then send
yellow level with Rover and Rush the blue in front of the riv and I'll be where I was before with the doing the
straight R peel the most extreme example of a delay occurs when both balls must score their
Straight Triple Peel
hoops together in a straight triple
peel okay I'm just lining up the balls to do a straight fullback
peel going to try and do a straight triple
so Blue's nicely
through now could Rush yellow all the way to the
boundary but i' rather just stay close to Blue be able
to make sure of getting a nice Rush on Blue just send the yellow back towards
the middle of the court I'm really
concentrating on trying to get blue in front of pen could of really hoping to
rely on scrambling Rover somehow if things go wrong I've got all four balls to play with so here I'm just going to
concentrate on getting a nice Rush on the blue to pealing
[Music] position it's going to try and rush it to about two yards straight in front of
the hoop and to miscut it if it's going to finish in front of the hoop it'll be
about an inch in front of the hoop i' be very lucky
there now I think this will go
through you're going to play it quite hard
[Music]
I'm going to quite an awkward place I'm going to
play quite a big risk here and play for black going into the near
wire so it'll help stop the [Music]
black and that was worked out quite well I got a nice Rush on the red and
I'm back to just having my standard straight R peel to do just got to make
the hoop Rush the red back over to a point down here so I can stop it up the court
Rush yellow down as well and I'll be back to having my Straight Rover peel
Half Jump
again sometimes with the straight Riv peel the PE e will Jaws here's how to
clear [Music]
it in this example I've tried to peel
blue uh while I'm making Rover and it's stuck so I'm going to play sh which is
called a half jump shot where I'm going to play a jump shot with black and the spin on black is going to carry black
through but I'm going to hit blue in the same stroke you go that's a nice clean half
jump shot turning our attention to the penultimate peel it sometimes occurs
Continuing from Jawsed Penult Peel (Std TP)
that the peel will Jaws after the attempt made at hoop six
okay in this position we managed to get blue into the jaws of panel after making
oop six that's really quite an easy position to deal
with just want to try and get a rush on red back to somewhere where I can send
red over to Freebay and get behind that blue
ball and rush it through the hoop so it's going to rush this back
towards the
boundary prefer to be a little bit closer to the blue I've got a quite a good stop shot
but now we approaching blue up the correct line as long as I'm short of blue I should have a nice hit on it up
the court through the hoop
so see one of the problems with this is I had to place red from quite a long way
away this is not an ideal place for peeling Rover going
to but at least I've got a fairly easy hit on Blue to get it up the
court and it's gone to quite a nice place where I can put it to Rover and
still stay very close to yellow and
back on track for the standard Rover peel before freeb
Continuing from barely peeled Penult Peel (Std TP)
back if the peel at penultimate only just clears the hoop another remedy is
required [Music]
now in this case we've put blue just 3 or 4 Ines through penal
mod this is perhaps the most awkward case we
get this time we got to take even greater care to make sure you can get a
rush on the blue if I didn't get a rush out of this
hoop to play a shot and try and get a rush on blue would be very
risky you have to be very worried about getting cross-wired on the blue ball so it's
extremely important to try and get a rush on red over to the east side of the lawn so
can now just play a stop shot and I'm guaranteed to be on the right side of the
hoop to rush the blue up towards towards the [Music]
[Music]
yellow I got a bit of curl there nearly managed to get partially W
but got some kind of Rush they' got quite a nice easy spot
to send Bluer over and get behind Yow again
[Music]
Death Roll
the penultimate peel can also be attempted after one back going towards two back
[Music]
now this position haven't quite managed to get the blue in the hoop
but got a chance to peel it in this case going to the yellow
ball so it's going to get a rush on red to somewhere where I can send it all the
way down to free back it's finished very very close to
the blue so I can just tap it with control
well I've hit it directly but that's doesn't seem to have done me too much harm one thing with this position
it's sometimes better to be slightly on this side maybe even when straight in front
because you just make sure that the pen out hoop is not blocking you from getting to the yellow
ball this is sometimes called the death roll because a lot of people break down
trying to do this they finish nowhere near the yellow and miss it or somehow fa to make two
back and it's probably only a good idea to do this if you are fairly good at rolling
so you can see it's a very effective way of peeling getting to that two pan here
I've still got a minor chance of peeling Rover going to free
back by rushing blue down in front of Rover from bip P out but obviously I
would have liked to have peeled blue all the way down to in front of Rover if I could have
Posthumous 4-back Peel
done as a final example of peeling let's look at the so-called postumus fullback
peel although it is is not part of the
triple okay here's an example what we call a potimus fullback
peel here we've we've tried to get the balls in position for a straight triple
but um unfortunately Blue's just to one side so I'm going to try and organize it
to peel blue after a make fall back this is really stopped being a
triple peel now I'm just looking to do one more peel while I get to the
peg what that does is it just improves your position slightly if you do get pegged out you're on penultimate rather
than fullback and also if you have trouble finishing you can finish from pen out a
little bit easier and you don't give away a lift if you do make a
mistake I tend not to do this I tend to actually just go to the Peg and
concentrating on making a perfect leave since it does rather leave the blue b behind even if you get it right through
you stick it in the Jaws it's really awkward to get back into your Brak again
Planned Practice
[Music] now the secret to gaining skill in peeling is like most other things in
planned practice here is a suggested program of
practice that I recommend to students firstly you should practice the three
ball brakes as we demonstrated in our first Tactics video next you should try making three
ball brakes which incorporate straight peels on the pilot ball at as many Hoops
as possible next I suggest practicing the straight Rover peel using an escape ball
and finishing the peg out of both
balls finally practice the delayed double peel peeling penultimate before
making four back these exercises will give you confidence at peeling and in
concluding a game you will also appreciate that you should not put your break at risk trying to get the fullback
peel done too early in the break now before we leave the subject of
peels some of you may find that knowing just a little more about the reasons for pull assist them in
Appendix: pull
practice three factors have a major influence on pull the nature of forces
the ball surface and imparted spin three factors are important in
understanding Force they have mag magnitude Direction and a point of application the magnitude is how hard
the ball is struck the direction is the line along which you swing the
Mallet and the point of application in a cro a stroke is the point where the two
balls touch to make it a little clearer let's transform our Mallet into a man pushing
the ball if he pushes it in the line of centers
it is the equivalent of pushing the front ball through the point of
application however if the forces applied at an angle to the line of
centers the force divides into two the force in the line of centers
will decrease and in
compensation a force from the side will be applied both forces will equal the
same magnitude of force as the original man but the effect is to
push the ball offline let's look at this a little more closely any force can be represented by
two smaller forces provided they total the same amount but as the angle of application
of a force increases the proportion of the two smaller forces will
alter but still total the same amount for example
as one force decreases the other must increase this Factor has a major
influence on the amount of pull in a cro stroke ball texture is also important a
hard smooth ball will not diverge as much as a softer grooved
ball spin can also be imparted partly through the texture and partly because
the force acts on the side of the ball the
spin will also add a slight curve in some
instances well you can see there are a lot of enjoyable skills for you to master as you learn about peeling so I'm
off to do some practice how about you
