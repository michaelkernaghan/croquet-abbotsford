Hi:=20

I didn't realize it would require permission. I should have contacted you s=
ooner; sorry about that.=20
To be precise, Abbotsford is still considering adding croquet, but it is ge=
tting there. Having equipment available helps in the effort.=20
I have enough equipment to do what is required through the end of this seas=
on, so please don't worry about it if its too much trouble,=20

Thanks,=20

Hi Michael,=20

Good to hear that Abbotsford has agreed to have croquet at their club. I wi=
ll need ot get permisssion from the Board at CP to have our unused equipmen=
t passed on. That tould be some hoops and balls.=20

The mallets would come from a member at Victoria Lawn club.=20

I don=E2=80=99t know how long it will take for the Board to get back to me =
but will let you know as soon as I have heard.=20

Cheers,=20

Hi, Michael =E2=80=94=20

We=E2=80=99ve been discussing getting the fledgling Abbotsford croquet grou=
p up and equipped, and another option has come to light.=20

Kathryn Cambridge, one of Victoria=E2=80=99s croquet movers and shakers, ha=
s been reviewing the equipment held by the Victoria clubs, with an eye towa=
rd removing things that aren=E2=80=99t used in order to make room for more =
things that are. You will understand that the material subject for removal =
is not top-of-the-line equipment, but it is generally playable and a hell o=
f a lot better than no equipment at all. Good stuff for use when learning t=
echnique. When you don=E2=80=99t have many balls and want to practice long =
shots, you tend to do a lot more walking than you=E2=80=99d really like in =
comparison to hitting. So a good supply of second-quality balls is useful.=
=20

Anyway, Kathryn is now figuring out what can be let go, especially to help =
startup clubs like Abbotsford. Down the line, when you do invest in better =
equipment, you can pass this introductory stock on to the next new club.=20

I=E2=80=99m sending this email to both of you so you can contact each other=
 to discuss what is available and what Abbotsford can use. I imagine Kathry=
n can send a couple of photos of the equipment that=E2=80=99s available, so=
 you have an idea what you=E2=80=99d be getting. It might be possible that =
some of this material could be delivered by an Islander to the Western Regi=
onals in August, where you could pick it up.=20

Regards, and thanks for the suggestion, Kathryn.=20
