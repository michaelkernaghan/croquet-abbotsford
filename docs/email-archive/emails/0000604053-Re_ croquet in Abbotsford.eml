Hi, Mike =E2=80=94=20

Excellent. I=E2=80=99ll send you some support materials from recent interac=
tions with lawn bowling clubs about starting croquet programs.=20

As for Croquet Canada=E2=80=99s assistance, we=E2=80=99ve instituted a poli=
cy of grants, for which new groups can apply. We=E2=80=99ve got limited fun=
ds, so it can=E2=80=99t be automatic, but new clubs aren=E2=80=99t beating =
down our doors. This year, a lawn bowling club in Edmonton has asked for su=
pport, but I think that=E2=80=99s the only group. I=E2=80=99ll be visiting =
them in May to help them get up and running.=20

Here=E2=80=99s the motion that established Croquet Canada's grant program:=
=20



A Motion=20

Establishing a Policy=20

for Providing Financial Support for New Croquet Clubs Purchasing Equipment=
=20



With the understanding that any funds provided through the policy described=
 be allocated with discretion, both in terms of the clubs being approved fo=
r grants and in terms of the amounts granted,=20



I, Pierre Dunn, a member of the Board of Croquet Canada, move=20



that Croquet Canada establish an ongoing program to grant matching funds to=
 clubs making equipment purchases in order to provide new croquet programs =
to their members, under the following conditions:=20

1) that the club seeking the grant be determined by the Board of Croquet Ca=
nada to be a club with good prospects for encouraging the growth of croquet=
 in Canada;=20

2) that the club have run a croquet program for less than two full years;=
=20

2) that the club receive no more than one grant in any one year;=20

3) that the club receive no more than two grants during the club=E2=80=99s =
existence;=20

4) that the grant in any one year amount to no more than $1000;=20

5) that the grant in any one year amount to no more than half the cost of t=
he equipment being purchased by the club in that year;=20

6) that the membership be informed of the existence of the program by appro=
priate announcements, and that the parameters of the program be clearly spe=
cified in a permanent location accessible through the internet;=20

7) that applicants be requested to provide specific information about their=
 programs to the CC Membership Committee when applying, and that the Member=
ship Committee review the applications and make recommendations to the Boar=
d for final disposition, in a timely fashion;=20

8) that the funds disbursed by Croquet Canada be paid directly by Croquet C=
anada to the supplier(s) of the equipment as partial payment for the order(=
s) made;=20

9) that the equipment be purchased from suppliers located in Canada;=20

10) that no restrictions be made as to whether the supplier(s) are commerci=
al providers, private individuals, or other clubs selling equipment surplus=
 to their needs; and=20

11) that Croquet Canada approves of the suppliers as providing reasonable v=
alue for the funds Croquet Canada provides.=20

The seventh condition listed in the motion calls for specific information a=
bout the new program. Below is a group of questions intended to elicit usef=
ul information. These questions are based on the notion that the croquet pl=
ayers will be members of the existing club, rather than a separate entity, =
like we used to have at West Point Grey years ago. In other words, please a=
dapt the questions to reflect the actual relationship between the croquet p=
layers and the lawn bowling club.=20
- - - - -=20


1) To your knowledge, how many croquet clubs with lawns of reasonable quali=
ty already exist in your city?=20

2) How many lawns will be available at your club for croquet play, and how =
often?=20

3) How many members do you hope to have playing croquet on a fairly regular=
 basis during the next year?=20

4) What sports are currently played regularly at your club?=20

5) Will your club be willing to accept members who want to join only to pla=
y croquet?=20

6) How much are you willing to spend over the next year to get your croquet=
 program up and running?=20

7) Are you interested in exchanging information with other clubs, hosting v=
isiting experts who can help your players improve, and sending your members=
 to other clubs for tournaments, friendly play, or training?=20
- - - - -=20
These questions do not need to be answered immediately, of course. Knowing =
that it may be possible to get a small grant toward your new club=E2=80=99s=
 equipment may influence the lawn bowling club=E2=80=99s decision, and may =
affect how the relationship between bowlers and croquet players is designed=
.=20

The Edmonton club provided a rather unique situation. The club itself has a=
bout 140 members, of which they expect about a half to try croquet; they=E2=
=80=99re going to try to add 50 croquet-only members to their ranks; and th=
ey also plan to use one of their four lawns for croquet on a regular basis.=
 In other words, a surprisingly healthy commitment. Since there are no croq=
uet clubs anywhere else in the area, supporting this one was kind of a no-b=
rainer.=20

I think the Abbotsford group would also be an excellent option. I remember =
driving over to the Abbotsford bowling club once while I was living in Vanc=
ouver (back before 2015), and deciding it would be worth pursuing. There wa=
s no one on the premises at the time, and I didn=E2=80=99t follow up, but c=
onsidering the number of retirees in the area it seemed an excellent prospe=
ct. If you can find some younger enthusiasts, that won=E2=80=99t hurt eithe=
r . . . The option for interclub play with Vancouver clubs makes the prospe=
ct even more appealing.=20

For your information, here=E2=80=99s the recommendation I made the Edmonton=
 people for a startup kit:=20

A Package for Two Courts/Sixteen Players=20
Balls 4 sets Sunshiny Pro16s 4 x $261 1,044=20
Hoops 2 sets Foxys 2 x 418 836=20
Mallets 8 Brighton IIIs, assorted sizes 8 x 165 1,320=20
Boundary Line 1 set, for two courts 100 est=20
Flags, Pegs homemade 100 est=20
Total cost new 3,400=20
Less maximum CC grant (1,000)=20

Total cost to club 2,400=20

As I said, I=E2=80=99ll get back to you soon with a few more materials.=20
