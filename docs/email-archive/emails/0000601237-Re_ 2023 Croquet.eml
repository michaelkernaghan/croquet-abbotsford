I had a good session yesterday at WPG. Russell came out too. 

Good to be on a full-sized flat lawn again :) 

I plan to go again in a couple of weeks.

Hi Michael, 
Still waiting on the club and ground staff to give me the all clear and a schedule 

It should be good to go in April 

I'm trying to set up an online booking system so that people can sign in and reserve a lawn at the designated times.. 
ONce I'm done grappling with that I'll let you know.. 

Should be good to go in April anyway 

Hope you're back in the groove now. I've hardly lifted a mallet since Happy Valley last august :(

Hi 

I plan to go to WPGLBC on next Monday (13th), and will likely do every third Monday if I can. 

I understand you are probably working, but just to let you know. 

Ff there is a day for AC in West Vancouver and I can try to come out. 

Have a great day, 
Michael Kernaghan

Hi Mike, 

Hope all is well with you! 

The lawns at West Van are still off limits due to reseeding until April I believe. 

Hopefully we can get you down for some play after that. I can sponsor you for membership for the first year and then you would be free to pop by whenever. 

Do you have any contacts for the croquet committee (if there is such a thing) at west point grey.. 

It would be good to coordinate some interclub activity with them and Dunbar croquet club seeming as we're all on the same side of the water.. 

Even if it was just a very basic beginner level golf croquet event or something. 

Hope all is well with you and that you had a good Christmas! 

Conor
