Thanks, Pierre=20

Good luck in the tourney. I hope the smoke is tolerable.=20

It would be great if there were funds this year, but it's not the end of th=
e world if it would be for next year.=20
I have equipment we can use. Enough for a 4 player game.=20

Have a great day,=20

Hi, Michael. I'm in Ontario at the national championships and will discuss =
this question with a couple other board members who are here. The question =
is not whether we have this kind of program, because we do. It was recently=
 used to subsidize the purchase of equipment for the new club in Edmonton. =
The question is how much we can spend each year, and whether there is money=
 left this year that can be used for this purpose. I'll keep you informed a=
bout what I find out.=20
Congratulations on getting the Abbotsford group interested. We'll work to p=
rovide whatever support we can.=20

Hi Pierre:=20

I did a demo session with the executive at Abbotsford Lawn Bowling, and it =
went very well. They are interested in adding croquet.=20
The treasurer would like more details about applying for an equipment bursa=
ry and how Croquet Canada can help with insurance.=20

Do you have more information on these topics?=20

Thanks,=20
