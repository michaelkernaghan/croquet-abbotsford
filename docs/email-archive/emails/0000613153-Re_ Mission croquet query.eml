Subject: Mission croquet query

Someone from out in Mission contacted me about getting croquet equipment

They seem interested in getting involved with croquet so I sent them your
email address

Hope that's okay!

Don't actually have a name for them.. they just texted out of the blue

Best of luck at Happy Valley
