Thanks Patrick 

That would be excellent 

Right now, it is a matter of economics. 

But there is lots of time, so we'll see. 

Are there ways to cut accommodation costs? 

Have a great day, 
Michael Kernaghan

Michael: 



Looks like you played pretty-well at the Victoria Days Event. I see that you have signed up for the August USCA AC Regional in Vancouver. I hope you also plan to come to the Pacific Cup in Rancho Mirage, CA in December (information attached). We already have 13 committed players for this event and expect to have 24+. Let me know if you have any questions.
