Hi Conor:=20

At the opening of Abbotsford Lawn bowling, I met with club members about ad=
ding Croquet. The treasurer and I talked to the mayor and the general manag=
er of parks recreation & culture.=20
I gave the Treauer letters and a proposal I got from Pierre. There is a wom=
an there who used to play croquet in Victoria and knows Pierre and Lorne.=
=20

See how that goes :)=20

Attending west van on Sunday was very helpful in preparing for this.=20

Would you like to be a director of the Fraser Valley Croquet Society?=20
It is a registered BC Society. I want someone to replace my son on the boar=
d.=20
There is no responsibility, and I can check that there is no liability :)=
=20

Have a great day,=20
