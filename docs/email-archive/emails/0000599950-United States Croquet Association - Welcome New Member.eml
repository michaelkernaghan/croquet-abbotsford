register; we have all your information saved. Please log in again to see if=
 you still have a pending payment.

If you decided to send in a check, the second email will be sent when we re=
ceive the check and process it. Until then, your membership will remain as =
Pending.

Your membership number is: 41504 
 Total Charge: 70.00
