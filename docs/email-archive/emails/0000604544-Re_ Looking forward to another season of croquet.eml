Good morning everyone, 

Looks like we are going to have some lovely warm and sunny weather for our opening day on Saturday. We are really looking forward to playing with you all again this year. Russell has made us a new sign up sheet (tab says 2023 booking) which you should all see when you look up the WPG Croquet Log In google sheet. If you are having trouble adding your x let me know and you are always very welcome to ask me to add your x - just phone or text my cell (604) 812-9765 or email me before hand. 

Today and tomorrow afternoon I will be giving some croquet lessons on a 3/4 court. Everyone is welcome to come for a refresher lesson or come and play a game or two of croquet. We can always put in a second court if needed. 

See you all soon, 

Sue
