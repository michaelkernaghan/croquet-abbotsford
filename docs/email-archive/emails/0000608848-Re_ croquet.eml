Thanks!=20

Another question they have is about fees and insurance. I know at WPG they =
simply grandparent all that from the Lawn bowling club membership.=20
But I understand there is some insurance arrangement available from Croquet=
 Canada.=20

Hi, Michael -=20

Yes, I=E2=80=99m back, bloodied but unbroken.=20

Okay. I was just reviewing my documentation on the equipment support progra=
m, which was approved by the CC board earlier this year. Here is the approv=
ed motion:=20
- - - - -=20


that Croquet Canada establish an ongoing program to grant matching funds to=
 clubs making equipment purchases in order to provide new croquet programs =
to their members, under the following conditions:=20

1) that the club seeking the grant be determined by the Board of Croquet Ca=
nada to be a club with good prospects for encouraging the growth of croquet=
 in Canada;=20

2) that the club have run a croquet program for less than two full years;=
=20

2) that the club receive no more than one grant in any one year;=20

3) that the club receive no more than two grants during the club=E2=80=99s =
existence;=20

4) that the grant in any one year amount to no more than $1000;=20

5) that the grant in any one year amount to no more than half the cost of t=
he equipment being purchased by the club in that year;=20

6) that the membership be informed of the existence of the program by appro=
priate announcements, and that the parameters of the program be clearly spe=
cified in a permanent location accessible through the internet;=20

7) that applicants be requested to provide specific information about their=
 programs to the CC Membership Committee when applying, and that the Member=
ship Committee review the applications and make recommendations to the Boar=
d for final disposition, in a timely fashion;=20

8) that the funds disbursed by Croquet Canada be paid directly by Croquet C=
anada to the supplier(s) of the equipment as partial payment for the order(=
s) made;=20

9) that the equipment be purchased from suppliers located in Canada;=20

10) that no restrictions be made as to whether the supplier(s) are commerci=
al providers, private individuals, or other clubs selling equipment surplus=
 to their needs; and=20

11) that Croquet Canada approves of the suppliers as providing reasonable v=
alue for the funds Croquet Canada provides.=20

- - - - -=20
You will note that item #7 stipulates that applicants be requested to provi=
de information. Here are the questions we would like the Abbotsford club to=
 answer. While you are gathering this information, I=E2=80=99ll check with =
the board and see how our financial situation looks in terms of providing s=
upport. I should have a reasonable answer to that in a few days.=20

The questions:=20


1) To your knowledge, how many croquet clubs with lawns of reasonable quali=
ty already exist in your city?=20

2) How many lawns will be available at your club for croquet play, and how =
often?=20

3) How many members do you hope to have playing croquet on a fairly regular=
 basis during the next year?=20

4) What sports are currently played regularly at your club?=20

5) Will your club be willing to accept members who want to join only to pla=
y croquet?=20

6) How much are you willing to spend over the next year to get your croquet=
 program up and running?=20

7) Are you interested in exchanging information with other clubs, hosting v=
isiting experts who can help your players improve, and sending your members=
 to other clubs for tournaments, friendly play, or training?=20
There are probably other questions that would be germane, but I think these=
 will provide a sense of whether the proposed Abbotsford program is serious=
 enough that Croquet Canada can justify supporting it. With that in mind, p=
lease understand that the $1000 figure is a one-year maximum, NOT an amount=
 that will automatically be provided if a decision is made to provide suppo=
rt.=20

One of the benefits the Abbotsford group has is you =E2=80=94 it=E2=80=99s =
always very valuable to have a knowledgeable player on hand to guide the gr=
oup and encourage activity and recruitment.=20

Regards!=20
