The balls are indistinguishable until an observer chooses one; this is an old problem :) 

Perhaps this game should be played in Copenhagen. 

I had in mind quantum teleportation. 

Black is for hoop 1, white for hoop 2 

There are white balls at hoop 4 and hoop 6 
There are black balls in corner IV and at hoop 2 

White is shot from near hoop 4 and hits the black ball in corner IV 
The White player now has either white ball in hand and can take croquet from either black ball 

So white takes croquet from the black ball at hoop 2, effectively 'teleporting' cross court to its hoop. 


But yes, it's a stretch and it will have trouble in peer review.

Interesting. If the choice is up to the striker, perhaps that is not indistinguishable. Perhaps the choice should be up to to a coin flip -- heads for the ball you hit & tails for the other? 
Best American, but not Best North American!

Sorry to extend my pestering into email land. I thought you should know I have a fix for the indistinguishable balls game. 

If white roquets a black ball, then since the black balls are indistinguishable, white can take croquet from either black. 

Congrats on winning best American.
