Hi, Michael =E2=80=94=20

Attached are a set of testimonials by lawn bowling clubs about their experi=
ence sharing with croquet; a proposal I sent to the Granville Park club whe=
n we discussed the option with them a year ago; some documents related to s=
tarting up the program at Victoria LBC, and some documents related to start=
ing things up at Gordon Head LBC. Some of the situations have changed since=
 these documents were prepared (for example, Croquet Canada has switched fr=
om lending equipment to providing grants for purchase of equipment), but th=
ere may be enough ideas here that you will find some useful things to explo=
re with the Abbotsford group.=20

We presented the testimonials to each of the clubs we=E2=80=99ve approached=
, for their info. We probably ought to obtain a more up-to-date set of test=
imonials that we can use in the future.=20

When you look at the documents about Victoria, keep in mind that they are r=
elated to the startup of a croquet program there. Now, that program has ove=
r 50 croquet players, of whom about 15 are also bowlers, so there is some o=
verlap. It also means that there are 35 non-bowlers who are providing about=
 $250 apiece in membership fees annually.=20

The croquet-playing members at VLBC have been closely involved in a number =
of construction projects upgrading the VLBC facilities, in greens maintenan=
ce, in =E2=80=9Chouse=E2=80=9D maintenance, and other activities.=20

Keep in mind also that VLBC and Granville Park are both clubs with two lawn=
s, so their situations allow for some kinds of uses of the lawns that singl=
e-lawn clubs don=E2=80=99t. Also, bowlers tend to meet for play in the earl=
y afternoon and regard that as having used the lawn for the day. Mornings a=
nd evenings often see the greens underutilized and free for other uses. In =
addition, I believe that successful programs will build in some weekend cro=
quet play, and also make sure and recruit players who are not bowlers. Croq=
uet players who are non-bowlers tend to try to find ways to keep the club s=
uccessful and croquet play available, whereas when all the croquet players =
are drawn from the bowling ranks they aren=E2=80=99t as committed. Commitme=
nt to the club, from whatever source, keeps the club thriving.=20

I=E2=80=99ll try to answer any questions you have about the attached items.=
=20

Regards!=20

Hi, everyone.=20

Georg Dej, who edits the =E2=80=9Ce-Mallet=E2=80=9D, Croquet Canada=E2=80=
=99s emailed newsletter, needs information about the tournaments that are c=
oming up in the West. I believe you are the people who can pull this inform=
ation together.=20

I=E2=80=99ve attached the list of events that we put together earlier this =
year. Some of these have been modified in one way or another, and even if t=
hey haven=E2=80=99t changed, more information is needed. Here=E2=80=99s wha=
t I need to know from you :=20

1) What exactly is the name of the event(s) you=E2=80=99ll be putting on as=
 part of the CSI program?=20

2) What version of croquet will be played at your event?=20

3) What are the dates of the event? What is the location?=20

4) Who can enter?=20

5) How much will entry cost?=20

6) Who should potential entrants contact to submit their application? Can t=
he same person respond to questions about the events?=20

ALSO =E2=80=94=20

Your club may be putting on additional tournaments apart from the CSI progr=
am. Please provide similar information about these events, even if only clu=
b members will be allowed to enter. (Part of what=E2=80=99s important here =
is to let the rest of Canada know what Western Canada is doing!)=20

Clubs in Vancouver should also provide this information about their own eve=
nts.=20

Please send the info to me , so I can compile it all into one listing that =
will be easy for Georg to plug into his publication. I=E2=80=99ll also send=
 him a small write-up about CSI, to help explain what we=E2=80=99re up to.=
=20

Thanks, everyone!=20
