What have I learned interacting with the people at West Van Club will be valuable.

Oh I went through Pierre.. He's the BC representative and he arranged it. 
I ordered two sets of equipment from oakley woods.. one invoice I paid for myself and then the other one was paid for by croquet canada.. 

Which reminds me.. we need as a club to pay that back :| 

When are you doing it? 

Hope it goes well!

Hi Conor: 

I got invited to do a croquet demo for the Abbotsford Bowling Club executive. 

I will show them a scaled-down version of what you have set up at West Vancouver, 
with some hoops for beginners and a reduced-scale golf setup. 

I borrowed some mallets, and I have an extra set of balls and hoops, so it should be ok. 

How did you acquire the equipment? You paid yourself; I think you said? 
I understand there is a bursary for new clubs from Croquet Canada. 

Have a great day, 
Michael Kernaghan
