## QUALIFICATIONS AND HISTORY

### Program Description (Copy this text):

This is an Introduction to Croquet course designed for adults and seniors seeking gentle outdoor recreation and social connection. The program teaches participants the fundamentals of croquet, including rules, court layout, proper technique, shot execution, and basic strategy.

Over six weekly sessions of 90 minutes each, participants will progress from learning the basics to playing full games confidently. The course includes instruction, guided practice, and supervised game play in a supportive, fun environment. All equipment (mallets, balls, hoops) is provided.

Croquet is an ideal activity for adults and seniors because it offers low-impact physical exercise, mental engagement through strategy, and opportunities for social interaction.

### Organization History and References (Copy this text):

The Fraser Valley Croquet Society (BC Society #S0075824) has been promoting croquet in the Fraser Valley region since 2023. We are a registered BC non-profit society and member organization of Croquet Canada. Our society was founded in Mission and has since expanded to include active programs in Abbotsford at the Mill Lake Park croquet courts. We continue to serve both communities and are excited to  \offer formal recreation programming in our founding community of Mission.

We host regular play sessions, tournaments, community demonstrations, and introductory workshops throughout the Fraser Valley. Our mission is to make croquet accessible to all community members across the region through quality instruction, inclusive programming, and community partnerships.

This is our first formal recreation course offering through the District of Mission, though we have extensive experience teaching croquet through society workshops, open houses, and demonstration events. Our instructors have successfully introduced hundreds of participants to the sport through our activities.

The Fraser Valley Croquet Society has experienced players who have participated in regional and national tournaments, comprehensive equipment resources, and a proven track record of welcoming and teaching new players. Our instructors understand adult learning principles and have adapted our teaching methods specifically for older adults and beginners. Bringing formal programming back to Mission honors our roots while building on our successful track record in Abbotsford.
