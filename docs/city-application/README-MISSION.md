# Fraser Valley Croquet Society - Recreation Course Applications

## Regional Approach

The **Fraser Valley Croquet Society** (BC Society #S0075824) operates across the Fraser Valley region. This allows us to apply to multiple municipalities including:
- District of Mission
- City of Abbotsford

Using the Society name (rather than "Abbotsford Croquet Club") removes confusion and accurately reflects our regional scope.
