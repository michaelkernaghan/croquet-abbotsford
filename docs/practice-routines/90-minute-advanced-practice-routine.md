# Advanced Practice Routine (90 Minutes)

A structured practice session for advanced Association Croquet players working toward triple peels. Based on the *Tame the Triple* ePractice Pack methodology, Keith Wylie's *Expert Croquet Tactics*, and MacRobertson Shield analysis.

---

## Warm-Up (10 min)
- **5 min:** Straight roquets from 5 yards - 10 shots
- **5 min:** Hoop running from 1 yard, dead center - 10 hoops

---

## Block 1: Triple Peel Sequences (35 min)
*Practice full triple peel sequences - the goal is repetition until ingrained*

### The Standard Triple Peel (17 min)
- **Setup from NSL**

### The Delayed Triple Peel (18 min)
- **Starting from Diagonal Spread Leave** with opponent in Corner 4

---

## Block 2: The Delayed Double Peel (15 min)
*Essential fallback when the full triple isn't feasible*

> The Penult peel after 3-back, followed by the Rover peel after Penult is one of the most important things for you to practise. Practise it regularly!

- **15 min:** Penult + Rover double peel sequence
  - Execute penult peel, maintain break to rover
  - Complete rover peel and peg out

---

## Block 3: Recovery & Plan B (10 min)
*What to do when peels go wrong - learn the alternative Plan B to get back on track*

- **5 min:** Jawsed peel situations
  - Recovery options when ball is stuck in jaws
  - Using the jaws strategically (intentional jawsing for later completion)

- **5 min:** Failed peel repositioning
  - Peel came up short - options to continue
  - Peel went too far - break adjustment
  - When to abandon safely and set up good leave

---

## Block 4: Leaves & Wiring (10 min)

- **5 min:** NSL (New Standard Leave) setup - this is your bread and butter
- **5 min:** Diagonal Spread Leave - alternate setup practice

---

## Cool-Down: Match Simulation (5 min)

- **5 pressure shots** - practice as seriously as if playing a match
  - "Otherwise you won't begin to see what can go wrong and how you can adapt in a game"
