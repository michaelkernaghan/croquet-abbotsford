# Advanced Practice Routine (90 Minutes)

A structured practice session for advanced Association Croquet players working toward triple peels. Based on the *Tame the Triple* ePractice Pack methodology, Keith Wylie's *Expert Croquet Tactics*, and MacRobertson Shield analysis.

> **Core principle:** Practice makes *permanent*, not perfect. You will ingrain whatever you practice, so practice with intention and correct technique from the start.

## Essential Tools
- **TP Journal:** Record your main learnings, especially reasons why you couldn't complete a triple
- **Practice buddy:** Share your practice sessions, compare mistakes and successes
- **This routine:** Loaded on your phone/tablet for on-court reference

---

## Warm-Up (10 min)
- **5 min:** Straight roquets from 5 yards - 10 shots
- **5 min:** Hoop running from 1 yard, dead center - 10 hoops

---

## Block 1: Key Shots (15 min)
*The fundamental peel shots you must ingrain*

- **5 min:** Angle/distance calibration for peels
  - Practice peels at varying angles and distances
  - Note: What is the maximum distance and angle you can reliably peel from?

- **5 min:** Straight peel shots
  - Drive peels - when peelee intentionally jaws for position

- **5 min:** Stop shot peels
  - The stop shot peel - decide which ball you would finish peeling
  - Practice getting correct weight to both balls

---

## Block 2: Journey Segments (20 min)
*Practice specific sections of the triple journey*

- **7 min:** Switching journeys mid-break
  - Practice recognizing when to switch from Standard to Delayed journey
  - Key trigger: when things don't go quite to plan

- **7 min:** Peeling through the partner ball
  - Not peeling from partner ball
  - Not peeling through partner ball
  - Standard journeys: peeling 4-back from an NSL with pilot near H2 and rushing to corner 4; peeling 4-back from an NSL with peelee at H1; finishing after an Irish peel at Fig 32

- **6 min:** Building up the break from a 2-Hoop Leave
  - Efficiently restarting after opponent's turn
  - Regaining 4-ball break position

---

## Block 3: Complete Journeys (25 min)
*Practice the full triple peel sequences - the goal is repetition until ingrained*

### The Standard Triple Journey (12 min)
- **Setup from NSL from H6** - the most common starting position
- **Setup from a 4-ball break with peelee as H1 pioneer**
- **Setup from Diagonal Spread Leave in Corner 4**

### The Delayed Triple Journey (13 min)
- **Starting from NSL with the H2 pioneer** - peelee at H1
- **Starting from a 4-ball break at H1** - with peelee as H1 pioneer
- **Starting from Diagonal Spread Leave** in Corner 4, with your rush to the H2 ball and in Corner 4 as you prefer

---

## Block 4: The Delayed Double Peel (15 min)
*Essential fallback when the full triple isn't feasible - pages 88-89 of Tame the Triple*

> The Penult peel after 3-back, followed by the Rover peel after Penult (Figs 83-86) is one of the most important things for you to practise. Practise it regularly!

- **8 min:** Penult + Rover double peel sequence
  - Setup: finishing the 4-back peel, picking up the 4-back pioneer
  - Peel 4-back with H2 pioneer from Corner 4 (Fig 25)
  - Execute the take-off (Fig 64)
  - Shepherd the peelee to get a rush to peg (Fig 32)
  - Practice positioning the 3-back remote pioneer (Fig 39)

- **7 min:** Transition drill
  - Recognize when 4-back peel has failed
  - Smoothly transition to double peel attempt
  - Setting up Corner 4 ball, finding the peel and remote 4-back

---

## Block 5: Recovery & Plan B (10 min)
*What to do when peels go wrong - learn the alternative Plan B to get back on track*

- **5 min:** Jawsed peel situations
  - Recovery options when ball is stuck in jaws
  - Using the jaws strategically (intentional jawsing for later completion)

- **5 min:** Failed peel repositioning
  - Peel came up short - options to continue
  - Peel went too far - break adjustment
  - When to abandon safely and set up good leave

---

## Block 6: Leaves & Wiring (10 min)

- **5 min:** NSL (New Standard Leave) setup - this is your bread and butter
- **5 min:** Diagonal Spread Leave - alternate setup practice

---

## Cool-Down: Match Simulation (5 min)

- **5 pressure shots** - practice as seriously as if playing a match
  - "Otherwise you won't begin to see what can go wrong and how you can adapt in a game"

## Four Types of Practice (from Tame the Triple)

1. **Complete Journeys** - Full triple peel sequences from start to finish
2. **Journey Segments** - Specific sections when things go wrong or right
3. **Key Shots** - The fundamental peel shots in isolation
4. **The Delayed Double Peel** - Your essential fallback option

*Rotate focus between these four areas across multiple practice sessions.*
