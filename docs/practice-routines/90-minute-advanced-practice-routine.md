# Advanced Practice Routine (90 Minutes)

A structured practice session for advanced Association Croquet players working toward triple peels. Based on the *Tame the Triple* ePractice Pack methodology, Keith Wylie's *Expert Croquet Tactics*, and MacRobertson Shield analysis.

> **Core principle:** Practice makes *permanent*, not perfect. You will ingrain whatever you practice, so practice with intention and correct technique from the start.

## Essential Tools
- **TP Journal:** Record your main learnings, especially reasons why you couldn't complete a triple
- **Practice buddy:** Share your practice sessions, compare mistakes and successes
- **This routine:** Loaded on your phone/tablet for on-court reference

---

## Warm-Up (10 min)
- **5 min:** Straight roquets from 5 yards - 10 shots
- **5 min:** Hoop running from 1 yard, dead center - 10 hoops

---

## Block 1: Key Shots (15 min)
*The fundamental peel shots you must ingrain*

- **5 min:** Angle/distance calibration for peels
  - Practice peels at varying angles and distances
  - Note: What is the maximum distance and angle you can reliably peel from?

- **5 min:** Straight peel shots
  - Drive peels - when peelee intentionally jaws for position

- **5 min:** Stop shot peels
  - The stop shot peel - decide which ball you would finish peeling
  - Practice getting correct weight to both balls

---

## Block 2: Triple Peel Segments (10 min)
*Practice specific sections of the triple peel sequence*

- **10 min:** Switching mid-break
  - Practice recognizing when to switch from Standard to Delayed triple
  - Key trigger: when things don't go quite to plan

---

## Block 3: Complete Triple Peel Sequences (25 min)
*Practice full triple peel sequences - the goal is repetition until ingrained*

### The Standard Triple Peel (12 min)
- **Setup from NSL from H6** - the most common starting position
- **Setup from a 4-ball break with peelee as H1 pioneer**
- **Setup from Diagonal Spread Leave in Corner 4**

### The Delayed Triple Peel (13 min)
- **Starting from NSL with the H2 pioneer** - peelee at H1
- **Starting from a 4-ball break at H1** - with peelee as H1 pioneer
- **Starting from Diagonal Spread Leave** in Corner 4

---

## Block 4: The Delayed Double Peel (15 min)
*Essential fallback when the full triple isn't feasible*

> The Penult peel after 3-back, followed by the Rover peel after Penult is one of the most important things for you to practise. Practise it regularly!

- **15 min:** Penult + Rover double peel sequence
  - Execute penult peel, maintain break to rover
  - Complete rover peel and peg out

---

## Block 5: Recovery & Plan B (10 min)
*What to do when peels go wrong - learn the alternative Plan B to get back on track*

- **5 min:** Jawsed peel situations
  - Recovery options when ball is stuck in jaws
  - Using the jaws strategically (intentional jawsing for later completion)

- **5 min:** Failed peel repositioning
  - Peel came up short - options to continue
  - Peel went too far - break adjustment
  - When to abandon safely and set up good leave

---

## Block 6: Leaves & Wiring (10 min)

- **5 min:** NSL (New Standard Leave) setup - this is your bread and butter
- **5 min:** Diagonal Spread Leave - alternate setup practice

---

## Cool-Down: Match Simulation (5 min)

- **5 pressure shots** - practice as seriously as if playing a match
  - "Otherwise you won't begin to see what can go wrong and how you can adapt in a game"

**Practice Goals Checklist:**
- [ ] Routes and ball positions understood and ingrained
- [ ] Understand my areas of success
- [ ] Know the alternative Plan B options
- [ ] Shot skills and fine-tuning improving
- [ ] Confidence building

## Four Types of Practice

1. **Complete Triple Peel Sequences** - Full triple peel from start to finish
2. **Triple Peel Segments** - Specific sections when things go wrong or right
3. **Key Shots** - The fundamental peel shots in isolation
4. **The Delayed Double Peel** - Your essential fallback option

*Rotate focus between these four areas across multiple practice sessions.*
