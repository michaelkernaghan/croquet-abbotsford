## Fundamental Techniques

### Stance & Swing Drills

| Drill | Description | Source |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Pendulum Swing Practice** | Practice swing without ball, focus on smooth backswing and follow-through | practice-drills.md |
| **Stop and Stare** | Hit ball, freeze position, count to 3 before looking up - trains head stillness | practice-drills.md |
| **Stance and Grip Check** | Feet shoulder-width, hands together, thumbs down shaft | practice-drills.md |

### Straight Shot Drills

| Drill | Description | Source |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **1-Metre Straight Shot** | Hit through hoop from 1m, progress to 1.5m, 2m when 7/10 success | practice-drills.md |
| **The Ladder** | Distance control: hit to markers at 1m, 2m, 3m, 4m, 5m and back | practice-drills.md |
| **Straight Roquets - 5 yards** | 10 shots, warm-up routine | 90-min advanced |

## Hoop Running

### Basic Hoop Drills

| Drill | Description | Source |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Dead Centre Hoop Running** | Run hoops from 1 yard, dead center - 10 hoops | 90-min advanced |
| **The Clock Face** | Approach from 12, 3, 6, 9 o'clock positions (2m out), 3 rotations | practice-drills.md |
| **Hoop and Position** | Run first hoop positioning for second hoop, target: 4 strokes for 2 hoops | practice-drills.md |

### Keith Aiton's Hoop Approach Technique

From *The Basics* (Section 2.3):

- **Ideal approach position**: 1 yard in front of hoop, straight on
- **Practice routine**: Set up 1-yard approach, run hoop with control
- **Key principle**: Running hoops with control directs ball to specific positions for advantageous rushes
- **Angled approaches**: Ball must clear near wire to succeed

## Roquet & Rush Drills

| Drill | Description | Source |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Roquet Practice** | Hit target ball from 2m, progress to 3m, 4m, track success rate | practice-drills.md |
| **Roquet Rally Game** | Take turns roqueting opponent's ball, first to 10 points | practice-drills.md |
| **Cut Rush Practice** | Angling to hit off-centre (like snooker/pool) | basic-ac-tactics |
| **Straight Rush Practice** | Hitting directly through centre | basic-ac-tactics |

---

## Croquet Shot Drills

### Shot Type Practice (From basic-ac-tactics.txt)

| Shot | Ratio | Key Points |
|------|-------|------------|
| **Takeoff** | Object stays, striker travels | Thin vs thick takeoff practice |
| **Stop Shot** | 1:5 to 1:10 | Strike below centerline, no follow-through |
| **Drive** | 1:3 | Normal stroke, foundation of break play |
| **Half Roll** | 1:2 | Downward strike, hands lower, stand forward |
| **Full Roll** | 1:1 | Both balls equal distance, topspin |
| **Pass Roll** | Striker goes further | Steep downward angle, difficult |
| **Split Shot** | 90° max divergence | Aim halfway between destinations |

### Croquet Shot Control Drill
- Place balls touching
- Practice sending partner ball:
  - Straight ahead (drive)
  - At 45 degrees (split)
  - Barely moving (stop shot)

---

## Break Play

### Two-Ball Break
- **Difficulty**: Hardest break, virtually no error margin
- **Practice**: Even experienced players struggle beyond a few hoops
- **Source**: basic-ac-tactics.txt

### Three-Ball Break (The Triangle Drill)
1. Set up balls in triangle near hoop
2. Roquet first ball, take croquet
3. Roquet second ball, take croquet
4. Position to run hoop
5. Run the hoop

**Goal**: Complete sequence in minimum strokes

### Four-Ball Break
- Most forgiving format
- **Key positions**: Striker's ball, pilot, pioneer, pivot
- **Pivot ball**: Mid-court, reduces travel distances

### Keith Aiton's Break Development Routine

From *The Basics* (Section 2.4):

> "Practice developing control through structured break play repetition"

- Focus on pilot/pioneer/pivot positioning
- Pioneer placement: keep within inner rectangle of outer hoops
- Rush toward useful balls rather than directly to hoops
- Plan pioneer establishment before making first hoop

---

## Leave Practice

### Standard Leaves (10 min block in advanced routine)

| Leave | Setup | When to Use |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **NSL (New Standard Leave)** | One opponent NE of H4 (wired from baulk), other as H3 pioneer | Bread and butter leave |
| **DSL (Diagonal Spread Leave)** | Opponent balls diagonally across court, partner as escape ball east | Most accessible, forgiving |
| **MSL (Maugham Standard Leave)** | NSL variant with west boundary ball on H2 wire | Superior pioneer placement |
| **Bryant Leave** | One at NSL H4, other 1cm north of H1 | Ultra-aggressive, forces opponent to shoot |
| **Summer Leave** | Park ball between H3-4, wired by peg from west boundary balls | Most forcing leave |

### Keith Aiton on Leaves

From *The Basics* (Section 2.5):

- **Golden Rules**:
  1. Final roquet should be partner ball (to organize quality rush)
  2. Complete final hoop off opponent's ball (leaving partner positioned)
- Position balls to restrict opponent options
- Create no short shots

---

## Opening Practice (Turns 1-4)

### First Ball Placements

| Opening | Position | Character |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **East Boundary** | Between H4-H5 level | Non-threatening, most common |
| **Supershot** | Mid-court near H5/peg | Aggressive engagement |
| **Anti-Duffer** | Between H6 and peg | Defensive |

### Second Ball Responses

| Response | Position | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Standard Tice** | West boundary, 8-13 yards from C1 | 1 yard longer than opponent's critical distance |
| **Duffer Tice** | 2 feet north, few inches east of penultimate | Encourages A baulk |
| **Micro Tice** | 2-3 yards from A baulk toward east | Cannot be refused |
| **Super Duper** | Response to wide super shot | Deep reverse Duffer Tice |

---

## Peel Practice (Advanced)

### Triple Peel Sequences (35 min block)

From 90-minute advanced routine:

1. **Standard Triple Peel** - Setup from NSL
2. **Delayed Triple Peel** - Starting from DSL with opponent in Corner 4

### Delayed Double Peel (15 min)

> "The Penult peel after 3-back, followed by the Rover peel after Penult is one of the most important things for you to practise. Practise it regularly!"

### Recovery & Plan B (10 min)

| Situation | Practice |
|-----------|----------|
| **Jawsed Peel** | Recovery options, intentional jawsing for later |
| **Peel Short** | Options to continue |
| **Peel Too Far** | Break adjustment |
| **Abandon Safely** | Set up good leave |

## Keith Aiton Specific Teachings

From scanned pages of *The Basics*:

### Section 2.2: General Comments on Croquet Strokes
- Smooth, unhurried swing with proper positioning
- Proper follow-through for natural forward-spin

### Section 2.6: Picking Up Breaks
- Identify closest opponent ball to next hoop as intended pilot
- Incorporate distant balls quickly into break structure
- "Shoot at the back ball" when opponents cluster

### Section 2.7: Standard Strokes and When to Use Them
- Match shot selection to situation
- Understand ratios for different stroke types

### Section 2.8: Miscellany
- Cut-rushing technique
- Ball positioning after R enters
- The roll approach from 11 to hoop 2

### Aiton's Key Insight (Page 13/36)

> "My final thought is to say that if you aspire to become the best croquet player you can be then you will probably need to appreciate the things you know you can do, the things you know you can master (but haven't quite yet), the diligence to turn the latter into the former, and the cool-headedness to assess what you need to do to win the match you are currently playing."

> "The gifted amateur practices until he can do it, whereas the professional practices until he cannot NOT do it."

## Pete Trimmer - Self-Development Drills

From *Beyond Expert Croquet*, Chapter 11: Self-Development (pp. 189-209)

### Key Physical Practice Principles

Trimmer's hierarchy of practice priorities:
1. **Rushing** - most valuable within 5-yard hitting range
2. **Croquet Strokes** - three outcomes: angle, ratio, power
3. **Controlled Hoop Running** - least well-recognised skill at top level

> "Practice whichever skill will most improve odds of winning matches" - not necessarily your weakest skill.

### Trimmer's Drills

| Drill | Description | Difficulty | Source |
|-------|-------------|------------|--------|
| **Basic Rush Practice** | Rush from corners to specific hoops, vary positions | Beginner | Trimmer p.190 |
| **Croquet Stroke Calibration** | From H1, send pioneer to H3 while going to H2. Adjust angle/ratio/power over 4 attempts | Intermediate | Trimmer p.192 |
| **Controlled Hoop Running** | Run hoop with imaginary 'rush line' behind - ball must stop between hoop and line | Intermediate | Trimmer p.193 |
| **Rush from Corner IV Routine** | Combination: rush, controlled hoop, croquet, rush to next | Intermediate | Trimmer p.194 |
| **Rob Fulford 2-Ball Break** | One ball in corner IV, croquet from ball a yard north. No 4th ball. Develop 3-ball break skills | Advanced | Trimmer p.196 |
| **Reg Bamford 2-Ball Break** | Repeatedly make H1 and H3 only (not all hoops). Every rush long, every approach must be sound | Expert | Trimmer p.196 |
| **Chris Clarke Controlled Hoop** | Rush to H1, run hoop getting peel position, send pioneer, continue pattern through H3, H4 | Advanced | Trimmer p.196 |
| **Opening Competition** | Two players: first to 3 hoops + established break wins round. Alternate who goes first | Intermediate | Trimmer p.202 |
| **Pressure Practice** | Imagine playing in final with crowd watching. Practice under simulated stress conditions | All levels | Trimmer p.206 |
| **Croquet Stroke Challenge** | Two players lay markers, closest ball wins point. 2 points for nominated "priority" ball | Intermediate | Trimmer p.208 |

### Trimmer's Technique Checklist (for Croquet Strokes)

Before each stroke, verify:
- [ ] Balanced at end of stroke?
- [ ] Shoulders free, grounded in legs?
- [ ] Lower hand at same point on shaft?
- [ ] Grip tightness consistent?
- [ ] Mallet direction selected before stroke?

### Break Hygiene Insights

Trimmer emphasises that break hygiene (tidiness) comes more from **tactical choices** than accuracy:
- Where to send pioneers/pivots
- Which side of pivot to land on
- Where to rush the pivot
- How to double-up when struggling

### Yerkes-Dodson Law

Performance follows inverted U-shape with stress:
- Too relaxed = poor performance
- Optimal stress = peak performance
- Too stressed = poor performance

Practice should include simulated pressure to build match readiness.
